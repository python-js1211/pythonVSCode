Update to the latest version of [`jedi`](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi) (`0.17.1`). This brings completions for Django (via [`django-stubs`](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs)) as well as support for Python 3.9 and various bugfixes (mostly around generic type annotations). (thanks [Peter Law](https://gitlab.com/PeterJCLaw/))
