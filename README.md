##[Issues and Feature Requests](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/issues)
* Support for Virtual Environments (in development)

## Feature Details (with confiuration)
* IDE Features
 + Rename and navigate to symbols
 + Go to, Peek and hover definition
 + Find all references
 + View Signature
 + Sorting Import statements (use "Python: Sort Imports" command)
* [Intellisense and Autocomplete](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Autocomplete-Intellisense)
 + Full intellisense
 + Support for docstring
 + Ability to include custom module paths (e.g. include paths for libraries like Google App Engine, etc)
 + Use the setting python.autoComplete.extraPaths = []
 + For instance getting autocomplete/intellisense for Google App Engine, add the following to your settings file:
```json
"python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
    "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/google_appengine",
    "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/google_appengine/lib" ]
```
* [Code formatting](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Formatting)
 + Use either yapf or autopep8 for code formatting (defaults to autopep8)
 + auutopep8 configuration files supported
 + yapf configuration files supported
* [Linting](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Linting)
 + It can be turned off (default is turn it on and use pylint)
 + pylint can be turned on/off (default is on), supports standard configuaration files
 + pep8 can be turned on/off (default is off), supports standard configuaration files
 + flake8 can be turned on/off (default is on), supports standard configuaration files
 + Different categories of errors reported by pylint can be configured as warnings, errors, information or hits
 + Path to pylint, pep8 and flake8 and pep8 can be configured
 + Custom plugins such as pylint plugin for Django can be easily used by modifying the settings as follows:
```json
"python.linting.pylintPath": "pylint --load-plugins pylint_django"
``` 
* [Debuggging](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/wiki/Debugging)
 + Watch window
 + Evaluate Expressions
 + Step through code (Step in, Step out, Continue)
 + Add/remove break points
 + Local variables and arguments
 + Multiple Threads and Web Applications (such as Flask) (Windows and Mac)
 + Expanding values (viewing children, properties, etc) (Windows and Mac)
 + Conditional breakpoints
 + Remote debugging
* Unit Testing
 + unittests (default is on)
 + nosetests (default is off)
 + Test resutls are displayed in the "Python" output window
 + Future release will display results in a more structured manner integrated into the IDE
* Snippets
