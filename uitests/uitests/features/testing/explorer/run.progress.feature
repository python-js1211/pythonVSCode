        Given a file named ".vscode/settings.json" is created with the following contents
            """
            {

    Scenario Outline: When running tests, the nodes will have the progress icon and clicking stop will stop running (<package>)
        Given the package "<package>" is installed
        And the workspace setting "python.testing.<setting_to_enable>" is enabled
        When I wait for the Python extension to activate
        When I select the command "Python: Discover Tests"
        And I wait for tests discovery to complete
        Then the test explorer icon will be visible
        When I select the command "View: Show Test"
        And I expand all of the test tree nodes
        And the file "tests/test_running_delay" has the following content
            """
            10
            """
        When I select the command "Python: Run All Tests"
        Then all of the test tree nodes have a progress icon
        And the stop icon is visible in the toolbar
        When I stop running tests
        Then the stop icon is not visible in the toolbar

        Examples:
            | package  | setting_to_enable |
            | unittest | unittestEnabled   |
            | pytest   | pytestEnabled     |
            | nose     | nosetestsEnabled  |
