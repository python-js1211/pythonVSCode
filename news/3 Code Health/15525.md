Add support for "Trusted Workspaces".

"Trusted Workspaces" is an upcoming feature in VS Code.  (See:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106488.)  For now you need
the following for the experience:

* the latest VS Code Insiders
* add `"workspace.trustEnabled": true` to your user settings.json

At that point, when the Python extension would normally activate, VS Code
will prompt you about whether or not the current workspace is trusted.
If not then the extension will be disabled (but only for that workspace).
As soon as the workspace is marked as trusted, the extension will
activate.
