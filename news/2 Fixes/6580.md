Changed the way scrolling is treated. Now we only check for the position of the scroll, the size of the cell won't matter.
Still the interactive window will snap to the bottom if you already are at the bottom, and will stay in place if you are not. Like a chat window.
Tested to work with: 
- regular code
- dataframes
- big and regular plots
Turned the check of the scroll at the bottom from checking equal to checking a range to make it work with fractions.
