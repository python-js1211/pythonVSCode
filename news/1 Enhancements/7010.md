Add `python.languageServer` setting with values of `Jedi` (acts same as `jediEnabled`),
`Microsoft` for the Microsoft Python Language Server and `None`, which suppresses
editor support in the extension so neither Jedi nor Microsoft Python Language Server
start. `None` is useful for those users who prefer using other extensions for the
editor functionality.
