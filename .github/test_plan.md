  <summary>Scenarios</summary>

### [Environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)
#### Interpreters

- [ ] Interpreter is [shown in the status bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_choosing-an-environment)

- [ ] `Run Python File in Terminal`
- [ ] `Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal`
  - [ ] Right-click

    zip.extractall('survey2017')
import shutil, os
shutil.move('survey2017/survey_results_public.csv','survey2017.csv')
shutil.rmtree('survey2017')
os.remove('survey2017.zip')
```
- [ ] *Shift+Enter* to send selected code in sample file to terminal works

#### Virtual environments

**ALWAYS**:
- Use the latest version of Anaconda
- Realize that `conda` is slow
- Create an environment with a space in their path somewhere as well as upper and lowercase characters
- Make sure that you do not have `python.pythonPath` specified in your `settings.json` when testing automatic detection
- Do note that the `Select Interpreter` drop-down window scrolls

- [ ] Detected a single virtual environment at the top-level of the workspace folder on Mac when when `python` command points to default Mac Python installation or `python` command fails in the terminal.
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)
- [ ] Detected a single virtual environment at the top-level of the workspace folder on Windows when `python` fails in the terminal.
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)
- [ ] Detected a single virtual environment at the top-level of the workspace folder
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)
  - [ ] [`Create Terminal`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_activating-an-environment-in-the-terminal) works
    - [ ] Steals focus

    - [ ] Installs into environment
  - [ ] [`Create Terminal`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_activating-an-environment-in-the-terminal) works
    - [ ] `"python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false` deactivates automatically running the activation script in the terminal
  - [ ] After the language server downloads it is able to complete its analysis of the environment w/o requiring a restart
- [ ] (Linux/macOS until [`-m` is supported](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/978)) Detected the virtual environment created by [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(pipenv)`)

- [ ] (Linux/macOS) Virtual environments created under `{workspaceFolder}/.direnv/python-{python_version}` are detected (for [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and its [`layout python3`](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/blob/master/stdlib.sh) support)
  - [ ] Appropriate suffix label specified in status bar (e.g. `(venv)`)

#### [Environment files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_environment-variable-definitions-file)
Sample files:
```python
# example.py
import os
print('Hello,', os.environ.get('WHO'), '!')
```
```
# .env
WHO=world
PYTHONPATH=some/path/somewhere
SPAM='hello ${WHO}'
````

**ALWAYS**:
- Make sure to use `Reload Window` between tests to reset your environment
- Note that environment files only apply under the debugger and Jedi

- [ ] Environment variables in a `.env` file are exposed when running under the debugger
- [ ] `"python.envFile"` allows for specifying an environment file manually (e.g. Jedi picks up `PYTHONPATH` changes)
- [ ] `envFile` in a `launch.json` configuration works
- [ ] simple variable substitution works

#### [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_python-interpreter-for-debugging)

- [ ] `pythonPath` setting in your `launch.json` overrides your `python.pythonPath` default setting

### [Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)

**ALWAYS**:
- Check under the `Problems` tab to see e.g. if a linter is raising errors

#### Language server

    - [ ] Import of `requests` without package installed is flagged as unresolved
    - [ ] Create a virtual environment
    - [ ] Install `requests` into the virtual environment

#### Pylint/default linting
[Prompting to install Pylint is covered under `Environments` above]

For testing the disablement of the default linting rules for Pylint:
```ini
# pylintrc
[MESSAGES CONTROL]
enable=bad-names
```
```python3
# example.py
foo = 42  # Marked as a blacklisted name.
```
- [ ] Installation via the prompt installs Pylint as appropriate
  - [ ] Uses `--user` for system-install of Python
  - [ ] Installs into a virtual environment environment directly
- [ ] Pylint works
- [ ] `"python.linting.pylintUseMinimalCheckers": false` turns off the default rules w/ no `pylintrc` file present
- [ ] The existence of a `pylintrc` file turns off the default rules

#### Other linters

**Note**:
- You can use the `Run Linting` command to run a newly installed linter
- When the extension installs a new linter, it turns off all other linters

- [ ] flake8 works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] mypy works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] pep8 works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] prospector works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] pydocstyle works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] pylama works
  - [ ] `Select linter` lists the linter and installs it if necessary
- [ ] 3 or more linters work simultaneously (make sure you have turned on the linters in your `settings.json`)
  - [ ] `Run Linting` runs all activated linters
  - [ ] `"python.linting.enabled": false` disables all linters
  - [ ] The `Enable Linting` command changes `"python.linting.enabled"`
- [ ] `"python.linting.lintOnSave` works

### [Editing](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing)

#### [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_autocomplete-and-intellisense)

Please also test for general accuracy on the most "interesting" code you can find.

- [ ] `"python.autoComplete.extraPaths"` works
- [ ] `"python.autocomplete.addBrackets": true` causes auto-completion of functions to append `()`
- [ ]  Auto-completions works

#### [Formatting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting)
Sample file:
```python
# There should be _some_ change after running `Format Document`.
import os,sys;
def foo():pass
```

- [ ] Prompted to install a formatter if none installed and `Format Document` is run
  - [ ] Installing `autopep8` works
  - [ ] Installing `black` works
  - [ ] Installing `yapf` works
- [ ] Formatters work with default settings (i.e. `"python.formatting.provider"` is specified but not matching `*Path`or `*Args` settings)
  - [ ] autopep8
  - [ ] black
  - [ ] yapf
- [ ] Formatters work when appropriate `*Path` and `*Args` settings are specified (use absolute paths; use `~` if possible)
  - [ ] autopep8

  - [ ] You are prompted to install `rope` if it is not already available
- [ ] [`Sort Imports`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_sort-imports) works

### [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)

- [ ] [Configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_debugging-specific-app-types) work (see [`package.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/master/package.json) and the `"configurationSnippets"` section for all of the possible configurations)

    1. Move your cursor to a line, but don't select anything. Shift-enter should send that line to the Interactive Window
- [ ] Multiple installs
    1. Close and re-open VSCode to make sure that all jupyter servers are closed
    1. Also make sure you are set to locally launch Jupyter and not to connect to an existing URI
    1. In addition to your main testing environment install a new python or miniconda install (conda won't work as it has Jupyter by default)
    1. In VS code change the python interpreter to the new install
